## About the organisation:
Who VR is focused on Digital Heritage, on a mission to marry the ancient with the modern, leveraging technologies like VR, AR, AI, Blockchain to recreate the History, Arts and Culture of our ancestors for the world to consume. As a part of Tourism Discovery and Heritage Proliferation, we create VR and AR capsules whereby tourists and discoverers can time-travel to the past and relive the ancient sites, temples and learn about them as they happen, in multi-sensory immersive experiences. We also aim to make History Enjoyable for Millennials and Gen-Z by creating new-age experiences in VR like VR Music Concerts (Product called ConcertSCAPE) and Heritage Games (Strategy Games, Ancient Board Games). WhoVR believes in conveying our culture, history, and heritage holistically using a combination of the arts, temple architecture, ancient sciences, astronomy, medicine, and psychology in order to demonstrate the breadth of our ancestors' knowledge and draw lessons for our modern society. Our team is made up of historians, neuroscientists, Vedic chant healers, filmmakers, and sound engineers who have come together to realise who we are and where we came from on a holistic level.

### Project Name: Indic Heritage – Vishnu Dashavatara Stories in Augmented Reality

#### About the Project
_The project would involve 2 parts_

-   _a) Marker/Object-based detection of Dashavatara Image/Figurines_
-   _b) Once detected, Animated storytelling with Audio Narrative on the user’s device_

_As the user scans her device (mobile/tablet) on the image or figurine of Dashavatara, the app on the device triggers stories of all the 10 avatars from Matsya, Kurma to Rama and Krishna. Animated storytelling of each avatar’s purpose, symbology and struggles/victories in tiny 4-minute capsules rich with photorealistic animation and scene rendering. Script/screenplay of the animation would be provided to the developer._

_The developer will work with seasoned mentors in animation technology and game engines and would be expected to create rich, immersive animation stories for 10 avatars and package the same into an app friendly with all devices (mobile/tablet)_

### Project Name: Indic Heritage – 3D-modeling of Indus Valley Civilization

#### About the Project
This project aims to reconstruct one of the most important port cities of the civilization i.e. Lothal. Our Knowledge partners and History partners will supply a range of photos and drawings around the city, the people and associated costumes, jewellery, gods etc. and the developer needs to 3D model the same into an authentic, immersive storytelling in Virtual Reality, the first of its kind on this ancient civilization. Scenes need to be created of various activities at the port. Audio narrative needs to be created to stitch all the information together as a cohesive storytelling. All details pertaining to knowledge, construction and script/screenplay would be provided to the developer. Intense reviews and scrutiny will be a part of the project and the end-deliverable is an APK for Meta Quest 1 and 2.
